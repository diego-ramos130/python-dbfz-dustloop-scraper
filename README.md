# python-dbfz-dustloop-scraper
 my first python project; writing a scraper to parse tables off dustloop's dbfz wiki for use with izzybot.

# How To Use: 
My python experience is extremely limited, so bear with me. 

You want to `git clone [this repo]`, `pip install scrapy` (assuming you have pip already) inside of that repo's directory, and then `scrapy run spider dbfz/the/spider/you/want/to/run.py -0 nameofjsonfile.json`.
that'll get you off the ground.

# Version 
`0.0.1` - prototype scraped Android 16's wiki page. Need to find a way to loop more intelligently, but the framework is there.
